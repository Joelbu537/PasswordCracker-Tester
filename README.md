# PasswordCracker-Tester
A tool to test the safety of your passwords by trying to crack them


In development:


When running the programm, you can choose 4 modes:

1. Normal            - Letters a-z/A-Z (Numbers and symbols are under development)  |52 characters
2. Normal/noAnalysis - a-z/A-Z WITHOUT stats                                        |52 characters
3. Raw               - a-z                                                          |26 characters
4. Raw/noAnalysis    - a-z WITHOUT stats                                            |26 characters

After choosing a mode, enter your password (remember to only use the symbols the mode can work with) and press [ENTER].
The program will now start to crack the password.

-REMEMBER- This process can take up to multiple days depending on the password, the mode and your PCs performance.
An approximate duration can be calculated by (Lenght of the password ^number of characters = Possible combinations/Combinations your PC can crack in one second).

After the process is finished, the programm will display the password ,and, if analytics are enabled, duration and attempts.
Press [ENTER] to exit
